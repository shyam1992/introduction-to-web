   <h3>Editor</h3>

   <h4>Recommended: Visual Studio Code</h4>

   <p>Sublime Text: I used this editor for years. Similar in style to VS Code. Also has a great ecosystem and is a fast editor.</p>
   <p>WebStorm: Sublime and VS Code's MO is more "here's a useful editor and not much more" whereas WebStorm is much "here's a useful editor and the kitchen sink". Whereas with VS Code you will likely install a few plugins to get everything you need, WebStorm will likely ship already with everything you need. You'll need to decide which approach suits you better.</p> 
   <p>vim and emacs - Don't use these,I personally recommend using an IDE which makes your life easier than using these terminal editors and end up spending more time in typing.</p>


   <h3>In-Browser Code Editor</h3>
   <p>In this course we will use CodePen a few times. It's an in-browser code editing experience and it makes it easy for you to learn. I suggest you head here and sign up for a free account so you fork the assignments to your own CodePen and you can refer to them later.</p> 
   <p>We will also use <b>Stackblitz</b> which is an online IDE which comes with all the pre-installed dependecies to develop Angular applications. The look and feel of this editor is mostly like VS code.</p>
