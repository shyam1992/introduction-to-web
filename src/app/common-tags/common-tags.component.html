   What are HTML Tags?
   HTML tags are simple instructions that tell a web browser how to format text. You can use tags to format italics, line breaks, objects, bullet points, and more. 
   These tags live in the HTML (or the Hypertext Markup Language) of every webpage. Put, HTML is the language of web pages.

   How Do Web Pages Read HTML Tags?
Servers read HTML code to understand and render content. It will read the HTML from top to bottom, much like how you’re reading this guide. 

You can use as many or as few tags as you like to format content. However, there are a few essential HTML tags and rules you’ll need to follow. 

An HTML tag must contain three parts:

<!-- "An opening tag — this will start with a < > symbol" -->
Content — the short instructions on how to display the on-page element
<!-- A closing tag — this will end with a code </ > symbol -->
<!-- However, some HTML tags can be unclosed. That means that the HTML tag does not need to be closed with a </ >. You’ll typically use unclosed tags for metadata or line breaks. -->
</p>

<p>Common tags</p>
<u> Underline Tag</u>
Here the <u> and </u> are the HTML tags and “Underline Tag” is the HTML element, i.e. the on page text. 

This tag will format any text between the opening <u> tag and the closing </u> tag as underlined.

<i> Italic Tag </i>
Here, the <i> and </i> are the HTML tags and “Italic Tag” is the HTML element (the on-page text.)

This tag will format any text between the opening <i> tag and the closing </i> tag as italic.

<b> Bold Tag </b>
Here the <b> and </b> are the HTML tags and “Bold Tag” is the HTML element, i.e. the on page text. 

This tag will format any text between the opening <b> tag and the closing </b> tag as bold.

<h2> Heading Tag </h2>
In this example, <h2> and </h2> are the HTML tags and “Heading Tag” is the HTML element, i.e. the on-page heading. 

Using this tag will format any text between the opening <h2> tag and the closing </h2> tag as a Heading 2 (a type of subheading.) 

<p> Paragraph Tag </p>
The <p> and </p> are the HTML tags and “Paragraph Tag” is the HTML element, i.e. the on-page text. 

This tag formats any text between the opening <p> tag and the closing </p> tag as a standard paragraph or main body text.
